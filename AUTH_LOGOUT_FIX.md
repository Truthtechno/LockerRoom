# Authentication & Logout Fix

## Problem
Users experiencing login glitches where:
1. After logging out as a student and logging in as school admin or system admin, they either get an error or get logged in as student again
2. Requiring multiple page reloads before being redirected to the correct portal

## Root Causes
1. **Stale cached data**: The `getCurrentUser()` function was falling back to cached localStorage data even when the API failed, potentially returning old user information
2. **Incomplete logout**: The `logout()` function only cleared localStorage items but didn't clear sessionStorage and didn't force a full page reload to clear React state
3. **No auth state refresh**: The `useAuth` hook only fetched user data once on mount, so when switching between users, the state wasn't being refreshed
4. **Inconsistent logout implementations**: Different components had different logout implementations, some more complete than others

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `logout()` function (`client/src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Now clears both localStorage and sessionStorage completely
- Triggers a custom 'auth-change' event to notify all components
- Forces a page reload via `window.location.href = '/login'` to ensure all React state is cleared
- This ensures a clean slate for the next login

### 2. Improved `getCurrentUser()` function (`client/src/lib/auth.ts`)
- Always fetches fresh data from the API - never uses stale cached data as fallback
- Properly handles 401 (Unauthorized) responses by clearing all auth data
- Returns `null` on errors instead of falling back to potentially stale localStorage data
- Validates token existence before making API calls

### 3. Enhanced `useAuth` hook (`client/src/hooks/use-auth.ts`)
- Now listens for storage changes across tabs
- Listens for custom 'auth-change' events to detect when login/logout happens
- Automatically refreshes user data when auth state changes
- Ensures the UI always reflects the current authentication state

### 4. Centralized logout calls
- Updated all components to simply call `logout()` 
- The function now handles all cleanup and redirection internally
- Removed redundant `updateUser(null)`, `setLocation("/login")`, and `localStorage.clear()` calls from individual components
- Files updated:
  - `client/src/pages/feed.tsx`
  - `client/src/components/navigation/sidebar.tsx`
  - `client/src/components/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - `client/src/components/navigation/header.tsx`
  - `client/src/pages/system-admin.tsx`
  - `client/src/pages/school-admin.tsx`
  - `client/src/components/admin/mobile-admin-nav.tsx`
  - `client/src/pages/settings.tsx`

### 5. Auth change events
- Both `login()` and `register()` functions now dispatch 'auth-change' events
- This ensures the `useAuth` hook immediately knows when authentication happens
- Provides real-time sync of auth state across the application

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Test logout/login flow**:
   - Login as student → logout → login as school admin (should go to school admin portal immediately)
   - Login as school admin → logout → login as system admin (should go to system admin portal immediately)
   - Try different role transitions to ensure no stale data

2. **Test session persistence**:
   - Login as one role
   - Don't logout, just close browser tab
   - Open a new tab and navigate to the app
   - Should still be logged in with correct role

3. **Test multiple tabs**:
   - Open app in two tabs
   - Login in one tab
   - Both tabs should reflect the login state
   - Logout in one tab
   - Both tabs should reflect the logout state

## Files Modified
- `client/src/lib/auth.ts` - Core auth logic improvements
- `client/src/hooks/use-auth.ts` - Auth state management improvements
- `client/src/pages/feed.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/components/navigation/sidebar.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/components/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/components/navigation/header.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/pages/system-admin.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/pages/school-admin.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/components/admin/mobile-admin-nav.tsx` - Simplified logout call
- `client/src/pages/settings.tsx` - Simplified logout call

## Summary
The authentication system now properly clears all cached data on logout and always fetches fresh user data from the API, preventing the "wrong user" glitches. The logout process is now consistent across all components and ensures a clean state for subsequent logins.
