# Restart Instructions

## The server is now configured to work properly on Windows

Please follow these steps:

### 1. Stop the current server
In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

### 2. Restart the server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the application
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5174
```

or 

```
http://127.0.0.1:5174
```

## What was fixed:

1. ✅ **npm scripts** - Now works on Windows using `cross-env`
2. ✅ **Server bind address** - Changed from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` for proper IPv4 binding
3. ✅ **Removed `reusePort` option** - This option isn't supported on Windows

The server should now be fully accessible in your browser!
