Update the LockerRoom project so that the **Student Portal** is fully responsive and functional:

1. **Feed Section Fixes**
   - Ensure the "Photo", "Video", and "Share" buttons are functional.
   - Photo/Video → allow uploading media to Cloudinary, saving reference in Supabase, and displaying it in the student feed.
   - Share → implement a working share modal with copy link + share to social.
   - All uploaded media should be auto-compressed for web-friendliness.

2. **Profile Tab**
   - Fix the bug where it shows "No profile found".
   - Ensure student profile data (name, class, DOB, guardian contact, profile picture) is fetched correctly from Supabase.
   - If a profile does not exist, auto-generate one for the logged-in student with default placeholder info.

3. **Stats Tab**
   - Fix the "404 Page Not Found".
   - Implement stats dashboard showing:
     * Total posts
     * Likes received
     * Comments received
     * Views
     * Followers
   - Data should be pulled in real-time from Supabase and displayed in responsive charts.

4. **Settings Tab**
   - Fix the "404 Page Not Found".
   - Implement student account settings:
     * Update profile info
     * Change password
     * Manage privacy (public/private account)
     * Upload/change profile picture

5. **Demo Data Injection**
   - Insert demo data into the system:
     * 2 System Admins (super_admin, moderator)
     * 2 School Admins (linked to sample schools)
     * 2 Schools with branding
     * 10 Sample Students per school with profiles
     * Each student should have at least 3 demo posts (photos/videos), likes, and comments for testing.
   - Ensure this demo data is only injected into the **development environment**, not production.

6. **Responsiveness & UX**
   - Verify the Student Portal UI is mobile-first, responsive, and matches XEN Sports Armoury colors (black, gold, white, grey).
   - Add proper error messages for failed uploads, invalid forms, and network issues.

7. **Documentation**
   - Create a new markdown file in the `docs/` folder named `student_portal_testing.md`.
   - This file should summarize:
     * Steps taken to test feed, profile, stats, and settings tabs
     * Screenshots (placeholders are fine)
     * Confirmation of demo data injection
     * Any known issues or limitations

Ensure that the fixes integrate with Supabase (for data) and Cloudinary (for uploads). All updates should maintain type safety, proper error handling, and responsive design.
