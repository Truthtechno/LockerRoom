# System Configuration Implementation - Complete Overview

## Summary

A comprehensive system configuration page has been implemented for the LockerRoom admin panel, allowing system administrators to configure branding, appearance (themes), and payment settings for the entire platform.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)

Three new configuration tables were added:

#### `systemBranding` Table
- Platform identity (name, logo, favicon)
- Company information (address, city, state, zip, country)
- Contact details (email, phone, website)
- Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn)

#### `systemAppearance` Table
- Theme mode (auto, light, dark)
- Light mode colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground, muted, border)
- Dark mode colors (primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground, muted, border)
- Typography settings (font family, base font size)

#### `systemPayment` Table
- Mock mode toggle (for development)
- Payment provider selection (Stripe, PayPal, none)
- Stripe configuration (publishable key, secret key, webhook secret)
- PayPal configuration (client ID, client secret, mode: sandbox/live)
- Pricing settings (currency, XEN Scout price, subscription prices)

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
Added methods to the `PostgresStorage` class:
- `getSystemBranding()` - Retrieve branding configuration
- `updateSystemBranding()` - Update branding settings
- `getSystemAppearance()` - Retrieve appearance configuration
- `updateSystemAppearance()` - Update appearance settings
- `getSystemPayment()` - Retrieve payment configuration
- `updateSystemPayment()` - Update payment settings

#### API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)
Added REST API endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/system-config/branding` - Fetch branding config
- `PUT /api/admin/system-config/branding` - Update branding config
- `GET /api/admin/system-config/appearance` - Fetch appearance config
- `PUT /api/admin/system-config/appearance` - Update appearance config
- `GET /api/admin/system-config/payment` - Fetch payment config
- `PUT /api/admin/system-config/payment` - Update payment config

#### Payment Integration (`server/routes.ts`)
Updated the payment intent endpoint to:
- Read payment configuration from database
- Respect mock mode toggle
- Support multiple payment providers (Stripe ready, PayPal placeholder)
- Use configurable pricing from database

### 3. Frontend Implementation (`client/src/pages/admin/system-config.tsx`)

A complete redesign of the system configuration page with:

#### Branding Tab
- Platform name and logo URLs
- Company address fields
- Contact information
- Social media links
- Real-time updates with instant saving

#### Appearance Tab
- Theme mode selector (Auto, Light, Dark)
- Light mode color pickers for all design tokens
- Dark mode color pickers for all design tokens
- Typography controls
- Visual color picker + hex input for each color

#### Payment Tab
- Mock payment mode toggle (perfect for development)
- Payment provider selection (Stripe, PayPal, None)
- Stripe configuration fields (when Stripe is selected)
- PayPal configuration fields (when PayPal is selected)
- Pricing controls
- Subscription settings

## Key Features

1. **Zero Data Loss**: All existing data is preserved. Only new tables are added.
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are saved immediately as you type
3. **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface with proper organization
4. **Mock Payment Mode**: Toggle for development vs production payments
5. **Flexible Theming**: Complete control over light and dark mode colors
6. **Comprehensive Branding**: Set platform name, logos, contact info, and social links
7. **Stripe Integration**: Ready for production with configurable pricing

## How to Apply the Changes

### Option 1: Using Drizzle Push (Recommended)
```bash
npm run db:push
```
When prompted about unique constraints, select "No, add the constraint without truncating the table" to preserve existing data.

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
Run the SQL migration file directly:
```bash
psql your_database_name < migrations/2025-01-30_system_configuration.sql
```

## Access the New Configuration Page

1. Login as a system admin
2. Navigate to `/admin/system-config`
3. Start configuring your platform!

## Mock Payment Mode

The mock payment mode is enabled by default. This allows you to:
- Test XEN scout submissions without real payments
- Develop and test the payment flow
- Switch to real payments (Stripe/PayPal) when ready for production

To enable real payments:
1. Go to Payment tab
2. Toggle "Mock Payment Mode" to OFF
3. Select payment provider (Stripe or PayPal)
4. Enter your API keys
5. Save configuration

## Default Values

- **Branding**: Platform name defaults to "LockerRoom"
- **Appearance**: Uses XEN Gold (#FFD700) as primary color
- **Payment**: Mock mode enabled, XEN Scout price $10.00

## Technical Notes

- All configuration is stored in separate tables (no migration of existing settings)
- Payment settings are encrypted in the database
- Changes take effect immediately without server restart
- The configuration respects role-based access (system_admin only)
- All API endpoints are protected with authentication and role checking

## Files Modified

1. `shared/schema.ts` - Added three new table definitions
2. `server/storage.ts` - Added CRUD methods for new tables
3. `server/routes.ts` - Added API endpoints and updated payment logic
4. `client/src/pages/admin/system-config.tsx` - Complete page redesign

## Files Created

1. `migrations/2025-01-30_system_configuration.sql` - Database migration
2. `SYSTEM_CONFIG_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Run the database migration
2. Start the server
3. Navigate to the configuration page
4. Customize your platform!

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check that you're logged in as system_admin
- Verify database connection
- Check browser console for any errors
- Review server logs for API errors

Happy configuring! ðŸŽ‰
