# Announcement Feed Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Announcements created by school admins or system admins were not visible in the student portal feed, even though the frontend PostCard component already had support for displaying announcements.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Issues
1. **Feed endpoint missing announcement logic**: The `/api/posts/feed` endpoint only fetched regular student posts and didn't include announcements
2. **Unused announcement storage method**: The `getAnnouncementsForUser` method existed in storage.ts but wasn't being called by the feed endpoint

### Frontend Issues
1. **Missing variable**: PostCard component referenced `isSystemAnnouncement` variable that wasn't defined

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (`server/routes.ts`)

**File**: `/server/routes.ts` (lines 1902-1935)

**Changes Made**:
- Modified the student feed logic to fetch announcements using `storage.getAnnouncementsForUser()`
- Added proper announcement scoping (global vs school-specific)
- Implemented announcement prioritization at the top of feeds
- Added deduplication logic to prevent announcement duplication

**Key Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Get announcements for this student (scoped to their school and global)
const announcements = await storage.getAnnouncementsForUser(userId, userRole, student.schoolId, limit, offset);

// Prioritize announcements at the top, then sort by creation date
posts = [...announcements, ...ownPosts, ...nonAnnouncementPosts].sort((a, b) => {
  // Announcements first, then by creation date
  if (a.isAnnouncement && !b.isAnnouncement) return -1;
  if (!a.isAnnouncement && b.isAnnouncement) return 1;
  return new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime();
});
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (`client/src/components/posts/post-card.tsx`)

**File**: `/client/src/components/posts/post-card.tsx` (line 35)

**Changes Made**:
- Added missing `isSystemAnnouncement` variable definition

**Key Code Changes**:
```javascript
const isSystemAnnouncement = announcementScope === 'global';
```

## Announcement Scoping Rules

The system now properly implements the following scoping rules:

### Global Announcements (`scope: 'global'`)
- **Created by**: System admins
- **Visible to**: All students across all schools
- **Display**: Shows "SYSTEM ANNOUNCEMENT" with megaphone icon

### School Announcements (`scope: 'school'`)
- **Created by**: School admins
- **Visible to**: Only students in that specific school
- **Display**: Shows "SCHOOL ANNOUNCEMENT • [School Name]" with megaphone icon

### Staff-Only Announcements (`scope: 'staff'`)
- **Created by**: School admins
- **Visible to**: Staff members only (excluded from student feeds)

## Frontend Display Features

The PostCard component already had comprehensive announcement support:

### Visual Styling
- **Background**: Yellow gradient background (`from-yellow-50 to-orange-50`)
- **Icon**: Megaphone icon in yellow/orange theme
- **Header**: Distinct announcement header with scope information
- **Border**: Yellow border to distinguish from regular posts

### Interaction Behavior
- **Likes/Comments/Saves**: Disabled for announcements (students can't interact)
- **Follow Button**: Hidden for announcements
- **Menu Options**: Simplified for announcements (no follow/save options)

### Content Display
- **Title**: Shows announcement title prominently
- **Content**: Displays announcement caption/content
- **Media**: Supports image/video attachments in announcements
- **Metadata**: Shows "Official Announcement" and creation time

## Database Schema

The announcement system uses the existing `posts` table with these key fields:

```sql
-- Announcement-specific fields in posts table
type: 'announcement'           -- Distinguishes from regular posts
title: text                   -- Announcement title
broadcast: boolean            -- Whether to show to target audience
scope: 'global'|'school'|'staff' -- Visibility scope
schoolId: varchar            -- Required for school-scoped announcements
createdByAdminId: varchar    -- Admin who created the announcement
```

## Testing

### Test Script Created
- **File**: `test-announcement-feed.js`
- **Purpose**: Verifies announcement visibility and feed endpoint functionality
- **Usage**: Run `node test-announcement-feed.js` (requires server running)

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create system announcement → Verify appears in all student feeds
- [ ] Create school announcement → Verify appears only in that school's student feeds
- [ ] Verify announcements appear at top of feed
- [ ] Verify announcement styling (yellow background, megaphone icon)
- [ ] Verify students cannot like/comment/save announcements
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness (iPhone 14 Pro Max in Chrome dev tools)

## API Endpoints

### Feed Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/posts/feed`
- **Changes**: Now includes announcements with proper scoping
- **Parameters**: `limit`, `offset`
- **Response**: Includes announcements at the top of the posts array

### Announcement Creation
- **System Admin**: `POST /api/system-admin/announcements`
- **School Admin**: `POST /api/schools/:schoolId/announcements`
- **Both endpoints**: Support image/video attachments via Cloudinary

## Files Modified

1. **`server/routes.ts`** - Fixed feed endpoint to include announcements
2. **`client/src/components/posts/post-card.tsx`** - Fixed missing variable
3. **`test-announcement-feed.js`** - Created test script (new file)
4. **`ANNOUNCEMENT_FEED_FIX.md`** - This documentation (new file)

## Expected Behavior

### For Students
- Announcements appear at the top of their feed
- Global announcements visible to all students
- School announcements visible only to students in that school
- Announcements have distinct yellow styling with megaphone icon
- Students cannot interact with announcements (like/comment/save)

### For Admins
- System admins can create global announcements visible to all students
- School admins can create school-specific announcements
- Both can attach images/videos to announcements
- Announcements are properly scoped and don't appear to unintended audiences

## Performance Considerations

- Announcements are fetched separately and then merged with regular posts
- Proper pagination support with `limit` and `offset` parameters
- Deduplication logic prevents announcement duplication
- Efficient sorting ensures announcements appear first without impacting performance

## Security

- Proper role-based access control for announcement creation
- School admins can only create announcements for their own school
- Announcements respect scoping rules (global vs school vs staff)
- No unauthorized access to announcement creation endpoints
