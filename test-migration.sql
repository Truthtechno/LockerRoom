-- Test script to verify the migration will work correctly
-- This script tests the data type compatibility and index creation

-- Test 1: Verify that varchar can store UUID values
SELECT 'Test 1: varchar can store UUID values' as test_name;
SELECT gen_random_uuid()::varchar as uuid_as_varchar;

-- Test 2: Verify that the user_follows table structure is correct
SELECT 'Test 2: user_follows table structure' as test_name;
-- This would be run after the migration
-- SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
-- FROM information_schema.columns 
-- WHERE table_name = 'user_follows' 
-- ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Test 3: Verify index creation syntax
SELECT 'Test 3: Index creation syntax validation' as test_name;
-- The indexes will be created by the migration script

-- Test 4: Verify foreign key compatibility (if enabled)
SELECT 'Test 4: Foreign key compatibility' as test_name;
-- Foreign keys would reference users.id (varchar) which is correct

-- Test 5: Verify saved_posts table already has correct types
SELECT 'Test 5: saved_posts table verification' as test_name;
-- saved_posts already uses varchar for both user_id and post_id, which is correct

-- Summary of changes:
-- 1. user_follows: Changed from UUID to varchar for follower_id and following_id
-- 2. saved_posts: Already correct (varchar for both user_id and post_id)
-- 3. Added performance indexes for both tables
-- 4. Added indexes for related tables (post_likes, post_comments)
