# LockerRoom System Admin Portal - Integration Test Results

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions and validation results for the newly implemented System Admin portal features. All features have been built with real database integration, responsive design, and production-ready functionality.

## System Architecture

### Database Integration
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle with type-safe schemas
- **Schema Management**: Automatic migrations with `npm run db:push`
- **Safety**: All new tables follow existing varchar UUID pattern for consistency

### New Database Tables
```sql
-- School Applications
school_applications: id(varchar), schoolName, contactEmail, status, reviewedBy, etc.

-- System Settings
system_settings: id(varchar), key, value, category, description, updatedBy

-- Admin Roles
admin_roles: id(varchar), userId, role, permissions[], assignedBy

-- Analytics Logs
analytics_logs: id(varchar), eventType, entityId, entityType, metadata, timestamp
```
