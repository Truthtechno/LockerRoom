## 🐛 Known Issues to Monitor

1. **Empty strings vs null**: Currently sending empty strings for cleared fields
2. **Multiple branding rows**: If migration runs multiple times, might create multiple rows (fixed with ordering)
3. **Cache invalidation**: Need to ensure all components refresh after updates

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Monitor server logs for any errors
2. Test on actual devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
3. Verify Cloudinary upload limits are appropriate
4. Consider adding image optimization/cropping for logo/favicon
5. Add loading states for better UX
