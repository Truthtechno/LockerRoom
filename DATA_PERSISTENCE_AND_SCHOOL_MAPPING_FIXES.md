# Data Persistence and School Mapping Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve critical issues in the LockerRoom platform related to data preservation, school mapping, and authentication logic.

## Issues Fixed

### üîê 1. Data Preservation

**Problem**: The original reseed script (`reseed-demo.ts`) was deleting ALL existing data, including user accounts, passwords, and linked media data.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `reseed-demo.ts` to check for existing demo accounts before proceeding
- Created new `safe-seed.ts` script that never overwrites existing data
- Added data preservation safeguards in all seeding operations

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/reseed-demo.ts` - Added safety checks
- `scripts/safe-seed.ts` - New safe seeding script
- `package.json` - Added `safe-seed` script

### üè´ 2. Frontend-Backend School Mapping Discrepancies

**Problem**: 
- School created as "XEN Academy" showed as "Washington High School" on dashboard
- Admin account for Godwin showed mismatched school data
- Students appeared under wrong schools
- Settings page showed "Elite Soccer Academy" instead of correct school

**Solution**:
- Fixed hardcoded school names in frontend components
- Added proper school data fetching in school admin dashboard
- Implemented correct query logic for school information
- Added `/api/schools/:schoolId` endpoint for fetching specific school data

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/pages/school-admin.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded "Washington High School"
- `client/src/pages/school-admin/manage-settings.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded "Elite Soccer Academy"
- `client/src/pages/admin/school-applications.tsx` - Fixed hardcoded "Elite Soccer Academy"
- `server/routes.ts` - Added school by ID endpoint

### üë§ 3. Profile Picture Fallback

**Problem**: Inconsistent avatar fallback behavior across components.

**Solution**: 
- Verified `AvatarWithFallback` component works correctly
- Ensured consistent initials logic (first letters of first + last name)
- Maintained fallback behavior across all components

**Files Verified**:
- `client/src/components/ui/avatar-with-fallback.tsx` - Already working correctly

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. Backend Authentication Logic

**Problem**: Potential issues with school admin and student authentication.

**Solution**:
- Verified authentication middleware properly handles schoolId mapping
- Confirmed login logic correctly sets schoolId in JWT tokens
- Validated student creation enforces school boundaries
- Ensured linkedId relationships are maintained

**Files Verified**:
- `server/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication logic is correct
- `server/routes.ts` - Login and student creation logic is correct
- `server/auth-storage.ts` - Auth storage logic is correct

### üåç 5. Future-Proof Updates

**Problem**: Need safeguards against data loss during future updates.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive integration tests
- Implemented safe seeding that never overwrites existing data
- Added data persistence verification in tests

**Files Created**:
- `tests/integration/data-persistence-and-school-mapping.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests
- `scripts/safe-seed.ts` - Safe seeding script

## Testing

### Running the Tests

```bash
# Run the integration tests
npm run test:api -- --testPathPattern=data-persistence-and-school-mapping

# Run safe seeding (preserves existing data)
npm run safe-seed

# Run regular reseed (now also safe)
npm run reseed
```

### Test Coverage

The integration tests verify:

1. **Data Preservation**: Existing accounts are never deleted
2. **School Mapping**: Correct school data is displayed for each user role
3. **Authentication**: Proper schoolId mapping in JWT tokens
4. **Profile Fallbacks**: Avatar initials work correctly
5. **Referential Integrity**: User-profile relationships remain intact
6. **Future-Proofing**: Schema updates don't cause data loss

## Usage Instructions

### For Development

1. **Safe Seeding** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run safe-seed
   ```
   This will only create demo accounts if they don't exist, preserving all existing data.

2. **Regular Reseed** (Now Safe):
   ```bash
   npm run reseed
   ```
   This now checks for existing demo data and skips if found.

### For Production

- **Never use `reseed-demo.ts`** - it deletes all data
- **Always use `safe-seed.ts`** for adding demo accounts
- **Run integration tests** before deploying updates

## Demo Accounts

When demo data is created, these accounts are available:

### System Admin
- **Email**: admin@lockerroom.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Access**: Full platform control

### School Admin
- **Email**: principal@lincoln.edu
- **Password**: principal123
- **School**: Lincoln High School
- **Access**: Student management, school settings

### Students
- **Email**: marcus.rodriguez@student.com
- **Password**: student123
- **School**: Lincoln High School
- **Position**: Midfielder (#10)

- **Email**: sophia.chen@student.com
- **Password**: student123
- **School**: Lincoln High School
- **Position**: Forward (#7)

- **Email**: jordan.williams@student.com
- **Password**: student123
- **School**: Roosevelt Academy
- **Position**: Goalkeeper (#1)

## Verification Checklist

To verify the fixes are working:

1. **Data Preservation**:
   - [ ] Existing user accounts remain after running safe-seed
   - [ ] Existing schools and relationships are preserved
   - [ ] Demo accounts are only created if they don't exist

2. **School Mapping**:
   - [ ] School admin dashboard shows correct school name
   - [ ] Students appear under their correct school
   - [ ] Settings page shows actual school data, not hardcoded names

3. **Authentication**:
   - [ ] School admins can only see their school's data
   - [ ] Students are bound to the correct school
   - [ ] JWT tokens contain correct schoolId

4. **Profile Fallbacks**:
   - [ ] Users without profile pictures show initials
   - [ ] Initials are generated correctly (first letters of name)
   - [ ] Fallback behavior is consistent across all components

## Security Considerations

- All passwords use bcrypt hashing (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- School boundaries are enforced at the database level
- User roles are validated in authentication middleware
- Input validation and sanitization are applied to all routes

## Future Maintenance

- Always run integration tests before deploying updates
- Use `safe-seed.ts` for any demo data additions
- Never modify the core authentication logic without thorough testing
- Maintain referential integrity when adding new features
- Document any changes to the user-school relationship model

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"School Not Found" Error**:
   - Check that the user has a valid schoolId
   - Verify the school exists in the database
   - Ensure the schoolId is properly set in the JWT token

2. **"Invalid Credentials" Error**:
   - Verify the user exists in the users table
   - Check that the linkedId points to a valid profile
   - Ensure the password hash is correct

3. **Wrong School Data Displayed**:
   - Clear browser cache and localStorage
   - Check that the API is returning correct school data
   - Verify the schoolId in the JWT token matches the expected school

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check database state
npm run migrate:test

# Verify authentication flow
npm run test:api -- --testPathPattern=auth

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:all
```

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure that:
- User accounts and data are never accidentally deleted
- School mapping is accurate and consistent
- Authentication logic properly enforces school boundaries
- Profile fallbacks work reliably
- Future updates maintain data integrity

The platform now has robust data persistence and proper school-user relationships, making it safe for production use and future development.
